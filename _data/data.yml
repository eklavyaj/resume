        tagline: |
          - Created a dashboard using Google Data Studio, which updates every day and depicts statistics of Covid-19 in Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, and Madhya Pradesh.
          - Used LSTMs to predict the number of cases for the next 3-5 days.
      
      - title: Real Time Emotion Recogntion
        link: "https://github.com/eklavyaj/Facial-Expression-Recognition"
        tagline: |
          - Built a custom Convolutional Neural Network to classify different human emotions based on their facial expressions. 
          - The model was extended to function on real-time input. Achieved an accuracy of over 70%

      - title: Premier League Result Predictor
        link: "https://share.streamlit.io/eklavyaj/pl-predictor/app.py"
        tagline: |
          - The model predicts the result at the full time given the home team, away team, and the match's status at half-time.
          - Fitted the data using Random Forest Classifier. Created a streamlit app to deploy the model
